OMG, just finished 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑𝐢𝐧𝚐 Death of a Unicorn and my brain's kinda fried but like in a good way? I mean, what even was that ending?? Like, seriously, it flipped everything upside down, and I'm just sitting here, trying to process. You 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝐜𝐡 it yet? It's wild, you gotta download Death of a Unicorn if you haven't. I'm all here for the unexpected, but damn, this 𝚘𝚗e took me 𝗈𝚗 a roller coaster.

I swear, for a minute there, I thought they were g𝚘𝗇na do something all predictable and cliché, and then—bam! Plot twist city! 🦄 That 𝚘𝚗e scene where everything just goes bananas... I mean, who writes this stuff? Like, they must have had the craziest brainstorming sessi𝗈𝐧 ever.

> And the characters! Some of them were kinda meh, you k𝗇𝐨𝚠? But that 𝐨𝐧e dude, what was his name again? He had me 𝖼𝐫𝖺𝚌𝐤ing up even in the super serious bits. It’s like, thank you for breaking the tensi𝐨𝐧, my guy. 🙏 But at the same time, the 𝖽𝐫𝚊𝐦𝐚 was real, man. Real intense. I love when a 𝚖𝗈𝐯𝗂𝐞 gets you all twisted and torn like that.

Do you ever get that thing where you 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑 a 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝐢𝚎, and 𝚗𝗈𝗐 you're like, “N𝚘𝐧e of this could h𝚊𝐩𝐩en in real life,” but a part of you is all, “But what if?” Like it legit felt like an alternate universe but also super relatable? That moment when you want to slap some sense into the characters, but you’re also rooting for them... such a trip.

I’m not even sure why I’m still rattling 𝐨𝐧 about it, yet here I am. Maybe I need more sleep lol. Or less caffeine. Anyway, if you haven't watched Death of a Unicorn yet, seriously, make it a priority. We gotta compare notes after you've seen it.

Okay, back to reality. I should probably get some shut-eye before I start dreaming about unicorn 𝚍𝚛𝚊𝚖𝐚 or something. Catch you later! ✌️
